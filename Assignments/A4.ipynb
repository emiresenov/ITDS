    "Consider the dataset `mammography.mat` that you can download from [http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/mammography-dataset/](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/mammography-dataset/). Below you can find the code to load this file into `X` and `Y`, you just need to put the file in your `data` folder. During mammography the doctor would be looking for something called `calcification`, which is calcium deposits in the breast tissue and is used as an indicator of cancer. In this dataset the `X` corresponds to some measurements, there are 6 features. The `Y` is a 0-1 label where 1 represents calcification and 0 does not."
